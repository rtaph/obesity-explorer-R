## Contributing to this Project

This dashboard repo is an academic project organized under the umbrella of the [UBC's Master of Data Science program](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/). 
As such, the authors welcome input about the analysis, but we are not accepting community contributions prior to February 15, 2021.


### Our Development Philosophy

 - We use a fork + pull-request (PR) approach to development. 
The `main` branch is protected and we require at least one reviewer per PR.

 - We search Github issues before contributing a PR to ensure a similar query has not yet been posed or closed.

 - We aim to create [minimal reproducible examples](https://rstudio.com/resources/webinars/help-me-help-you-creating-reproducible-examples/) whenever discussing bugs or problems.
We attempt to do this on Docker before reporting an issue, when possible.

 - We document everything with `roxygen2`, `docopt`, or docstrings.

 - We strive to write code that adheres to the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) (for R) and [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) (for Python). We do this for consistency and ease of collaboration, rather than for its own sake. 
When appropriate, we welcome deviations from style. 

 - We test our code using `testthat` or analogous frameworks.

 - We try to write code that will be reproducible across platforms and time.
